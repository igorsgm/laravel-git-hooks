```bash
php artisan git-hooks:register
```

Once you've configured and registered the hooks, you're all set!

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ General Usage
### Usage of the configured Pre-commit Hooks
To use the pre-configured pre-commit hooks provided by this package, simply edit the `pre-commit` section of the `git-hooks.php` config file. Here's an example of how to configure them:
```php
'pre-commit' => [
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\PintPreCommitHook::class, // Laravel Pint
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\PHPCodeSnifferPreCommitHook::class, // PHPCS (with PHPCBF autofixer) 
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\PHPCSFixerPreCommitHook::class, // PHP CS Fixer
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\LarastanPreCommitHook::class, // Larastan
    // \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\EnlightnPreCommitHook::class, // Enlightn
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\ESLintPreCommitHook::class, // ESLint
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\PrettierPreCommitHook::class, // Prettier
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\PhpInsightsPreCommitHook::class, // PhpInsights
    \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Console\Commands\Hooks\RectorPreCommitHook::class, // Rector
],
```

### üîß Auto-fix Capabilities

By default, the pre-commit hooks will stop at the first failure and will not continue with the remaining tools.
If the tool contains a fixer option, it will prompt in the CLI to run the fix command.

The package includes powerful auto-fix functionality that can automatically resolve code style and formatting issues:

- **Interactive Fixing:** By default, when an issue is detected, you'll be prompted to run the fix command
- **Automatic Fixing:** Enable `automatically_fix_errors` to fix issues without prompts
- **Smart Re-running:** Enable `rerun_analyzer_after_autofix` to automatically verify fixes succeeded

This behavior can be adjusted using the following parameters from the `git-hooks.php` config file:
```php
    // config/git-hooks.php
return [
    ...
    'automatically_fix_errors' => false,
    'rerun_analyzer_after_autofix' => false,
    'stop_at_first_analyzer_failure' => true,
];
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Usage

### üê≥ Laravel Sail Support

If you are using Laravel Sail and local PHP is not installed, you can adjust the following parameters in the `git-hooks.php` config file.
This will force the local git hooks to use the `sail` command to execute the hooks:
```php
    // config/git-hooks.php
    'use_sail' => env('GITHOOKS_USE_SAIL', false),
```


### üê≥ Docker Support

By default, commands are executed locally; however, this behavior can be adjusted for each hook using the parameters `run_in_docker` and `docker_container`:

```php
    // config/git-hooks.php
    'run_in_docker' => env('LARAVEL_PINT_RUN_IN_DOCKER', true),
    'docker_container' => env('LARAVEL_PINT_DOCKER_CONTAINER', 'app'),
```

### üîßü™≤ Advanced Configuration Options & Debug Mode

The `git-hooks.php` config file offers several debug options that can be adjusted using the following parameters.
It also provides additional configuration options for fine-tuning hook behavior:

```php
    // config/git-hooks.php
return [
    ...
    'artisan_path' => base_path('artisan'),
    'validate_paths' => env('GITHOOKS_VALIDATE_PATHS', true),
    'analyzer_chunk_size' => env('GITHOOKS_ANALYZER_CHUNK_SIZE', 100),

    'output_errors' => env('GITHOOKS_OUTPUT_ERRORS', false),

    'debug_commands' => env('GITHOOKS_DEBUG_COMMANDS', false),
    'debug_output' => env('GITHOOKS_DEBUG_OUTPUT', false),
    ...
];
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Creating Custom Git Hooks
1) If you need to create a custom Git hook for your project, Laravel Git Hooks makes it easy with the `git-hooks:make` Artisan command. To create a new custom hook, simply run the following command:
    ```bash
    php artisan git-hooks:make
    ```
    This command will prompt you to choose the type of hook you want to create (e.g., `pre-commit`, `post-commit`, etc.) and to provide a name for the hook. Once you've provided the required information, the command will generate a new hook class in the `app/Console/GitHooks` directory.
2) To start using your custom hook, open the generated file and implement the `handle()` method with your desired logic.
3) Add your custom hook to the appropriate array in the `git-hooks.php` config file:
```php
'pre-commit' => [
    // Other pre-commit hooks...
    \App\Console\GitHooks\MyCustomPreCommitHook::class,
],
```
4) Finally, register your custom hook by running the Artisan command:
```bash
php artisan git-hooks:register
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Git Hooks
### Pre-commit Hook
> The pre-commit hook is run first, before you even type in a commit message. It's used to inspect the snapshot that's
> about to be committed, to see if you've forgotten something, to make sure tests run, or to examine whatever you need to
> inspect in the code. Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the commit, although you can bypass it with git commit
> --no-verify. You can do things like check for code style (run lint or something equivalent), check for trailing
> whitespace (the default hook does exactly this), or check for appropriate documentation on new methods.

```php
// config/git-hooks.php
return [
    ...
    'pre-commit' => [
        \App\Console\GitHooks\MyPreCommitHook::class,
    ],
    ...
];
```

```php
// App/Console/GitHooks/MyPreCommitHook.php

namespace App\Console\GitHooks;

use Closure;
use Igorsgm\GitHooks\Git\ChangedFiles;

class MyPreCommitHook implements \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Contracts\PreCommitHook
{
    // ...

    public function handle(ChangedFiles $files, Closure $next)
    {
        // TODO: Implement your pre commit hook logic here.

        // If you want to cancel the commit, you have to throw an exception.
        // i.e: throw new HookFailException();

        // Run the next hook in the chain
        return $next($files);
    }
}
```

### Prepare-commit-message Hook
> The prepare-commit-msg hook is run before the commit message editor is fired up but after the default message is
> created. It lets you edit the default message before the commit author sees it. This hook takes a few parameters: the
> path to the file that holds the commit message so far, the type of commit, and the commit SHA-1 if this is an amended
> commit. This hook generally isn't useful for normal commits; rather, it's good for commits where the default message is
> auto-generated, such as templated commit messages, merge commits, squashed commits, and amended commits. You may use it
> in conjunction with a commit template to programmatically insert information.

```php
// config/git-hooks.php
return [
    ...
    'prepare-commit-msg' => [
        \App\Console\GitHooks\MyPrepareCommitMessageHook::class,
    ],
    ...
];
```

```php
// App/Console/GitHooks/MyPrepareCommitMessageHook.php

namespace App\Console\GitHooks;

use Closure;
use Igorsgm\GitHooks\Git\CommitMessage;
use Igorsgm\GitHooks\Contracts\MessageHook;

class MyPrepareCommitMessageHook implements \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Contracts\MessageHook
{
    // ...

    public function handle(CommitMessage $message, Closure $next)
    {
        // TODO: Implement your prepare commit msg hook logic here.

        $currentMessage = $message->getMessage();
        // You can update commit message text
        $message->setMessage(str_replace('issue', 'fixed', $currentMessage));

        // If you want to cancel the commit, you have to throw an exception.
        // i.e: throw new HookFailException();

        // Run the next hook in the chain
        return $next($message);
    }
}
```

### Commit-msg Hook
> The commit-msg hook takes one parameter, which is the path to a temporary file that contains the commit message
> written by the developer. If this script exits non-zero, Git aborts the commit process, so you can use it to validate the commit message format.


```php
// config/git-hooks.php
return [
    ...
    'commit-msg' => [
        \App\Console\GitHooks\MyCommitMessageHook::class,
    ],
    ...
];
```

The class structure of the `commit-msg` hook is the same as the `prepare-commit-msg` hook, shown right above.

### Post-commit Hook
> After the entire commit process is completed, the post-commit hook runs. It doesn't take any parameters, but you can
> easily get the last commit by running git log -1 HEAD. Generally, this script is used for notification or something
> similar.

```php
// config/git-hooks.php
return [
    ...
    'post-commit' => [
        \App\Console\GitHooks\MyPostCommitHook::class,
    ],
    ...
];
```

```php
// App/Console/GitHooks/MyPostCommitHook.php

namespace App\Console\GitHooks;

use Closure;
use Igorsgm\GitHooks\Git\Log;
use Igorsgm\GitHooks\Contracts\PostCommitHook;

class MyPostCommitHook implements \Igorsgm\GitHooks\Contracts\PostCommitHook
{
    // ...

    public function handle(Log $log, Closure $next)
    {
        // TODO: Implement post commit hook logic here.

        // You can interact with the commit log
        $hash = $log->getHash();
        $author = $log->getAuthor();
        $date = $log->getDate();
        $message = $log->getMessage();

        // If you want to cancel the commit, you have to throw an exception.
        // i.e: throw new HookFailException();

        // Run the next hook in the chain
        return $next($log);
    }
}
```

### Pre-push Hook
> The pre-push hook runs during git push, after the remote refs have been updated but before any objects have been
> transferred. It receives the name and location of the remote as parameters, and a list of to-be-updated refs through
stdin. You can use it to validate a set of ref updates before a push occurs (a non-zero exit code will abort the push).

```php
// config/git-hooks.php
return [
    ...
    'pre-push' => [
        \App\Console\GitHooks\MyPrePushHook::class,
    ],
    ...
];
```

The class structure of the `pre-push` hooks is the same as the `post-commit` hook shown above, but implementing `\Igorsgm\GitHooks\Contracts\PrePushHook` interface.
